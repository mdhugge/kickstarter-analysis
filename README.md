# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who came to me for assistance in funding her play; Fever. In a short period of time she almost reached her fundraising goal. She would know like me to determine how her fundraising campaign compares to other theatre fundraising campaigns. Specifically, she is interested in how successful or unsuccessful a campaign is based on their funding goals and the date the campaign was launched. To perform this analysis for Louise, I used data obtained from Kickstarter campaigns around the world.

### Purpose
Help Louise compare her campaign to similar campaigns.
 
## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to provide results that are most relevant to Louise I filtered for theatre campaigns only. I created a pivot table that compared the month the campaign was launched to the outcome of the campaign. Using the pivot table, I created a line chart to visually demonstrate the relationship between outcome of campaign and the launch month.

### Analysis of Outcome Based on Goals
To perform an analysis of the outcome of a campaign based on the goal, I had to first gather and organize my date. I grouped campaigns by ranges of goal amounts. I than used the `COUNTIFS` function to determine how many successful campaigns there were based on each goal range. I repeated this with failed and canceled campaigns as well. In order to provide information that is most relevant to Louise, when preforming the `COUNTIFS` function I filtered for plays only. I used the `SUM` function to determine the total number of campaigns for each goal range. I determined a percentage of successful campaigns by dividing the number of successful campaigns in a goal range by the total number of campaigns for that goal range. I repeated this with failed and canceled. Using the goal ranges and the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns I created a line chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encoutered

I was able to perform an analysis of outcomes based on lauch date without any difficulties. A possible challenge that could have arose is determining where each dataset should placed in the pivot table. Although, it is clear that I want to perform an analysis on the outcome of a campaign based on when it was launched, I had to determine for myself where each set of data would be placed in the pivot table.

When doing the analysis of outcome based on goals using the `COUNTIFS` function was challenging because there were a lot of criteria to filter for and it required going between two spreadsheets. Another element that added to the confusion was understanding the language used in excel functions. I broke down each component to help me grasp the concept of the `COUNTIFS` function. To understand the symbols used in the function I performed a google search. To understand each criteria of the equation I had to understand what I am trying to achieve from the fucntion (e.g. when I am looking for number of successful play campaigns that have a goal of less than 1000 I need to filter for the subcategory plays, successful outcomes and goals that are less than 1000). 

## Results
- What are two conculsions you can draw about the outcomes based on launch date?

Based on the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date analysis it is clear that the number of successful theatre campaigns is greatest in the month of May. It is also evident that theatre campaigns that are launched in the month of December are less likely to be successful due to the .

- What can you coclude about the outcomes based on goals?

From the Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis it is apparent that the number of successful play campaigns is greater when the goal is lower and having a goal less than $5000 is ideal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A limitation of this dataset is that we only have data up until February 2017 and we cannot confidently say that campaigns launched in 2020 will perfrom similarly. Additionally from this dataset we do not know how these campaigns were marketed (e.g. social media or word of mouth). These limitations are important to consider as campaigns launched in 2020 may not see the same amount of success due to the financial impacts of COVID-19 on backers as well as the limitations to face-to-face marketing. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a clustered column graph to visulaize the realtionship between country and precentage of successful, failed and cancelled play campaigns. This graph would allow us to analyze which countries produce the highest number of successful play campaigns. Another graph that would provide further analysis is a clustered column graph that shows the realationship between average number of backers and the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled play campaigns. This chart would tell us the avergae number of backers that a successful play campaign has.
